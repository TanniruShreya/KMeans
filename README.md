# KMeans

# Project Title:

#Analysis and prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv" of American mall arket called as Phonix Mall
#To find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop. On the bases of this prediction of annual income vs spending scores 

# Disclamer:

In this particular dataset we assume annual income as a centriod and spending score from the rane 1 to 100 called as data node of the cluster 

# Problem Statement:

The American Finace Market as per the GDP of 2011 'Phonics_Trillums Mall' as in the first range out of 5.

The owner of the mall wants to be excat which particular shop all product such in different kind of clusters in entire mall.

As a DataScience Engineer predict the futuristic finaical market GDP rate based on number of clusters.

The client wants atleast top 5 clusters[shops]   


# Conclusion:

According to the model basic prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm KMeans Clustering we found that custer-1 which consists Red colour is a highest cluster whixh attach more than 50 Data Nodes.

# Refrences:

The model buliding algorithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values.

The yellow spots represents Centroids are max of only 3
